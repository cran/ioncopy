Description: Method for the calculation of copy numbers and calling of copy number alterations. The algorithm uses coverage data from amplicon sequencing of a sample cohort as input. The method includes significance assessment, correction for multiple testing and does not depend on normal DNA controls. Budczies (2016 Mar 15) <doi:10.18632/oncotarget.7451>.
